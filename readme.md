Fullstack Junior Developer (Intern) Test

Thank you for the opportunity; this was a good challenge for me.

## To run the app:

- Install MongoDB Compass and connect to the server with the command `npm start` on your terminal.
- With another terminal, navigate to the "front" folder and connect to the front-end with the command `ng serve`.
- It's ready to use.

- Login: admin

I'm looking forward to hearing from you and receiving feedback on my project.

Best regards,
